* Use at your own risk.
* This software is currently detected as malware because it is "unknown" and mines cryptocurrency and is based off of "BitcoinMiner".  Since this application uses computer resources it is classififed as a potentially unwanted application (PUP).
* DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE ON PRODUCTION OR MISSION CRITICAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS.  SECKC (or anyone involved with this project) IS NOT RESPONSIBILE FOR ANY PROBLEMS CAUSED FROM USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.  I AM TYPING IN ALL CAPS SO YOU KNOW I AM SUPER SERIOUS GUYS!
* None of the authors, contributors, administrators, vandals, or anyone else connected with SecKC, in any way whatsoever, can be responsible for your use of this software or software contained in or linked from these repositories.
